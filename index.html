        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Spencer Hoile has been in the Occupational Safety field for the past 5 years, working with several maufacturing facilities as a Safety Engineer. 
            With most of my experience being in manufacturing, the scope of my career has been roughly the same at each company I have worked. 
            My main tasks inclue leading internal safety audits, for both safety and environmental concerns and managing our employee-led safety programs, improving said programs and increased participation.
            Maintaining a clean and safe facility means keeping up with tasks on a monthly basis.
            Conducting monthly safety trainings across the company, performing monthly inspections, including emergency exits, extinguishers and blood borne pathogen kit, weekly and monthly environmental inspections, including stormwater inspections.
            Recordkeeping is important for safety trainings for all employees, as well as introducing new employees to the safety policy, updating evacuation rosters, and employee termination lists
